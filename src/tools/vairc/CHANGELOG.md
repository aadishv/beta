# VAIRC Component Changelog

## Security and Stability Improvements

### JSON Validation and Error Handling

- Enhanced the SSE event handler to properly validate JSON structure before processing
- Added type checking for all detection objects to prevent runtime errors
- Added specific validation for pose data to ensure it contains required numeric properties
- Improved error logging to help with debugging
- Truncated large error messages to prevent console flooding
- Added graceful degradation when receiving invalid data

### Component-Level Validation

- Created validation utility functions to centralize and standardize validation logic
- DetailsPanel: Added checks for valid detection objects before accessing properties
- DetectionCanvas: Added validation to skip invalid detection objects when rendering
- FieldView: Added type checking for field coordinates and robot pose data
- Layout: Changed default state to have an empty array for detections to prevent null reference errors

### Validation Utilities

- Added `safeGetStuff()` utility function to safely extract detection arrays without causing errors
- Added `isValidDetectionPayload()` for checking overall payload structure
- Added `isValidDetection()` for validating individual detection objects
- Added `ensureValidPayload()` to provide a default payload structure when needed

These changes make the VAIRC interface more resilient against:
- Malformed JSON data from the server
- Missing or corrupt detection properties
- Incomplete pose or object data
- Network interruptions during data transmission
- Undefined or null property access errors

The application will now gracefully handle these issues with appropriate warnings rather than crashing or showing incorrect visuals.
