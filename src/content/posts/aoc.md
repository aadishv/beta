## Introduction

[please ignore how late this is]

This (last? 2024's) winter, I completed the Advent of Code (AoC) 2024 puzzles every night from December 1 through December 25. It was a bit easier for me than for the poor chaps on the East Coast as the puzzles were released at 9:00 pm PT (midnight Eastern time) and I could often have them solved and go to sleep by 10:00 pm. Anyways, here are a few scattered thoughts on what I learned and gained.

This was my first year doing AoC, I only discovered it because of a group of AoC competitors at OHS.

## My setup

- All of my original solutions are in Python. I used the [`advent-of-code-data`](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) package with a custom runner script to get puzzle input. The runner script basically continuously reran my program with a 5s wait in between in each run. It used `exec` to run my solution so it could declare the puzzle input as a variable and then let my solution access it -- this, of course, ended up not being the best option chiefly because of naming conflicts between the runner script and solutions, but it worked.
- I used the [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor for my solutions, as I have for all of my coding projects for the past year or so. (Sorry VSCode, but I know an Electron app when I see it -- Zed is unimaginably fast)
- For the first few days, I used [Supermaven](https://supermaven.com) code completion because I had it enabled by default and it definitely sped up the process, but stopped after realizing it violated the AoC rules.
- I used a [utilities file](https://github.com/aadishv/aoc/blob/main/utils.py), which basically just stored useful functions and data structures. This ended up being a godsend despite me having to rewrite it about 2-3 times.
  This included vector2 and grid classes, a myriad group of list-related utilities, tools for parsing inputs, and many other random things. The most useful utilities by a long shot were the vector and grid classes -- see [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1heuw9l/2024_day_15_im_tired_boss/) to understand. The vast majority of my solutions actually no longer work ðŸ˜‚ because of how often I changed my utilities file. Updating them wouldn't be too hard but I'm too lazy to do so.

## Stuff I learned

I learned _so much_ stuff through doing AoC. Here are the highlights:

**Python-specific**

- How to properly structure a Python project. I haven't done many large Python things in a while, so this was a bit of a refresher.
- Regex! Believe it or not I had near zero experience with regex before AoC, so learning it through a handful of tutorials and getting practice with the `re` library in Python was nice.
- At the time I didn't understand Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* (and would be too lazy to implement them even if I did know them) so I gained a lot of experience using the `networkx` library.
- The Python STD libraries like `itertools`, `functools`, `copy`, and `collections`.

**More generally**

- Problem-solving skills. After (or during) solving a day's puzzle, us OHSers would often trade optimizations and ideas for solutions, which not only helped me solve the tasks but also taught me algorithmic thinking yada yada.
- Thinking about a 2D grid and vectors/vector transformaions - believe me, it becomes much easier to visualize a grid after solving 20 AoC problems about them.
- Patiently waiting for code to finish executing.
- General algorithms -- probably the coolest I learned was dynamic programming (to solve [Day 19](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/19)).
- A bunch of other things that I'm not willing to explain.

## Standout puzzles

1. My initial solution for [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6) part 2 didn't work; I still don't know why. I submitted the wrong answer something like 5 times in a row. I eventually (23 hours later, one hour before the next puzzle) buckled down and rewrote it.
2. All of [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8) was honestly a pain for me, especially since I didn't have good grid or vector utilities then. I would keep on messing up my pluses or minuses or doing a similar silly mistake. It took me a while to do it, despite the problem itself being relatively simple.
3. In [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8), it took me a while to realize that numbers could be longer than 1 digit ðŸ˜­.
4. I spent hours pondering [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/13), even rewatching a linear algebra series, before realizing that it was a simple linear equation...
5. [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/20) was an absolute mess, took an hour just for me to understand the problem. Even just using the optimized networkx implementation of Dijkstra's wasn't enough and I had to use a lot of optimizations for part 2.
6. There were around three puzzles that I had to take a hint from the subreddit from, and [Day 21](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/21) Part 2 was probably the toughest of them. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to create a recursive memoized function for it.
7. Many puzzles in Advent of Code were challenging, but [Day 24](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/24) Part 2 was the holy grail of AoC problems for me. It took me ages to just find my bearings; I ended up using a hybrid approach using a program to detect errors, manually fixing and noting them, and continuing until it worked. I actually solved Day 24 Part 2 after solving Day 25 Part 1, as I needed to have solved every other problem in order to complete Day 25 Part 2

## Rust!

AoC was a great way to spent my December (perhaps not the best way to spend my finals week) but I quickly got bored as winter break set in and AoC finished. In order to not die of said boredom I decided to learn Rust - a language that I've been wanting to learn for a while (because it looks like Swift, which I love, but is actually cross-platform) but seemed daunting. Welp, I had a lot of free time and nothing else to do, so I YOLOed it and learned Rust.

To be honest, I still only somewhat understand Rust's memory management but just the elegance of the language is amazing -- probably the best DX I've experienced (especially the notion of a unified build tool with `cargo`). In order to gain a better understanding of the language and learn helpful functions, I decided to start redoing some AoC24 puzzles in Rust. I'm only up to day 9 and am currently on a break from them but it was definitely a fun learning experience.

Through the AoC puzzles, I got experience with:

- The Rust compiler
- Cargo's package management (for importing the regex library)
- Using the standard IO crate
- Quirks of Rust (&str vs. String, iterators vs. Vec, etc.)
- More optimizations, especially when rewriting my grid utilities in Rust. Specifically, I tried out storing coordinates as a u16 where the first 8 bits were the x-coordinate and the last 8 bis the y-coordinate, which improved performance a lot :)
- Much much more

Definitely worth my time!

## Conclusion

Just for fun, here is my performance on AoC for the initial (Python) run -- pretty mediocre but still a blast.
